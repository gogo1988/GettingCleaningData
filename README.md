# *Getting and Cleaning Data* Course Assignment

## Introduction:

This documents  is a project finished to fulfill the requirements fo

## Activities to be done:

1. Create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
2. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
3. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
4. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
5. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
6. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


# Required R packages

1. "plyr"
2. "reshape2"


## Raw Data Source:
Please download and uncompress the data files using the following hyperlink:

[https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) 

## Working Directory

" ~/DataCleaning/project/"

In the working directory:

1. A data file folder: UCI HAR Dataset (it is obtained by uncompressing the downloaded file from the hyperlink provided above)

2. A R function file: run_analysis.R 

3. README.md

The following two text files are produced by running "run_analysis" function

4. mergedData.txt (it is produced by the 4th step of the "Activities to be done" )

5. tidyDataset.txt (it is produced by the 5th step of the "Activities to be done")
